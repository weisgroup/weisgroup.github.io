Our research group is at the forefront of developing innovative sensing, communication, and networking technologies to transform robotics, autonomous systems, and everyday devices. We tackle the full spectrum of challenges, from building an initial system prototype to understanding real problems, then developing a theoretical model, coming up with theoretical breakthroughs to practical prototype development for breakthroughs, and finally, deployment in the real world.
