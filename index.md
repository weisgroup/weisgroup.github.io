# MetaIoT Lab
Here at Mobile, Sensing, Automative & Internet of Things Lab (MetaIoT), which is leaded by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://metaiot.group/) in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. we create the next generation of intelligent wireless systems for communication and sensing with applications in autonomous systems, IoT network, wireless communication and sensing.

## Research Overview
Our research group is currently focused on the following key areas: 
- **Wireless SLAM, mmWave 3D Perception:** including mmWave for autovehicle navagation, sensing, V2X, and interference cancellation applications.
- **Backscatter Communication/Sensing:** including WiFi/BLE/LoRa/GPS backscatter communication and localization applications
- **Video Compression/Transmission for Edge IoT:** such as reliable video streaming for UAVs and batteryless devices, 3D Lidar point cloud compression, etc.

Some of our completed research includes:
- WiFi Sensing and Localization by repurposing the pervasive signals for Human Sensing, Indoor Navigation, and finding hidden IoT devices.
- Backscatter Communication for Battery-free IoT: including WiFi/LoRa/BLE Tags, and backscatter localization.
