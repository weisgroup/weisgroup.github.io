# MetaIoT Lab
Here at Mobile, Sensing, Automative & Internet of Things Lab (MetaIoT), which is leaded by [Prof. Qian Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/) and [Prof. Wei Wang](https://weisgroup.github.io/weiwang.html). We create the next generation of intelligent wireless systems for communication and sensing with applications in autonomous systems, IoT network, wireless communication and sensing.

## Research Overview
Our research group is currently focused on the following key areas: 
- **Wireless SLAM, mmWave 3D Perception:** including mmWave for autovehicle navagation, sensing, V2X, and interference cancellation applications.
- **Backscatter Communication/Sensing:** including WiFi/BLE/LoRa/GPS backscatter communication and localization applications

Some of our completed research includes:
- WiFi Sensing and Localization by repurposing the pervasive signals for Human Sensing, Indoor Navigation, and finding hidden IoT devices.
- Backscatter Communication for Battery-free IoT: including WiFi/LoRa/BLE Tags, and backscatter localization.
