# MetaIoT Lab
Here at Mobile, Sensing, Automative & Internet of Things Lab (MetaIoT), which is leaded by [Prof. Qian Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/) and [Prof. Wei Wang](https://metaiot.group/weiwang.html). We create the next generation of intelligent unmanned systems for sensing and perception with applications in autonomous systems, AIoT, and embodied AI.

## Research Overview
- **mmWave/multi-modal 3D Perception and SLAM:** including mmWave perception, multi-modal SLAM/navigation for embodied AI and self-driving vehicles.
- **AIoT:** including AIoT hardware design and embedded systems for industry and healthcare.
